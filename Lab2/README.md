# Lab 200 - Provisioning your Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instance

![Oracle Analytics Cloud](/images/oac_banner.png)

This section describes the process of deploying **Oracle Analytics Cloud** instances on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2, which is the default for newly provisioned accounts in **EMEA** and **US**.

Your Oracle Cloud Free Tier account will use the Oracle Cloud Free Trial **credits** while this instance is provisioned, as Oracle Analytics Cloud is not part of the **Always Free** cloud services.

Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance can take over **40 minutes**.

Watch our short video that explains Lab 2 - Provisioning your Oracle Analytics Cloud instance:

Return to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console accessing from **Oracle Home Page** (oracle.com) and sign in into your cloud account.
Click in **View Account** and **Sign in to Cloud**.

Click on the menu icon on the left. Verify that you are signed in as a **Single Sign On** (Federated user) user by selecting the **Profile** icon
in the top right hand side of your screen. If your username is shown as:

>
Then you are **connected** as a **Single Sign On** user.

If your user does not contain the identity provider --(**oracleidentitycloudprovider**), please logout and select to authenticate
using **Single Sign On**.

To be capable of using **Oracle Analytics Cloud** we need to be Sign-On as a **Single Sign-On** (SSO) user.

[More information about federated users](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingscim.htm).

Return to the *Home Console Page* and navigate to **Analytics** under **Solutions and Platform** section and then **Analytics Cloud**.
