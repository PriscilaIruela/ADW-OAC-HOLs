# Appendix A - Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud Instance


If your Oracle Cloud account started before 14 February 2020 (USA) or 2nd March 2020 (EMEA), you have the option to deploy Oracle Analytics
Cloud Instances using a different method. This is documented below for completeness, but it is expected that people running the workshop to use
the Oracle Analytics Cloud on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2, which is documented in the main body of the document.

Your Oracle Cloud Free Tier account will use the Oracle Cloud Free Trial credits while this instance is provisioned, as Oracle Analytics Cloud is
not part of the Always Free cloud services.

Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance can take over 40 minutes. If you plan to run Lab 300 during the classroom session, then
you can provision the instance now and have it ready for use later.

Return to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, click on the menu icon on the left. Verify that you are signed in as a Single Sign On
(idcs) user by selecting the **Profile** icon in the top right hand side of your screen. If your username is shown as:

oracleidentitycloudservice / \<your username\>

Then you are connected as a Single Sign On user.

If your username is shown as:

\<your username\>

Then you are not signed in as an Oracle Cloud InfrastructureÂ user.

If your user does not contain the identity provider --

using Single Sign On.
