# Lab 000 - Creating and connecting to your Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account

- SAME AS LAB0 ATP+ODA

During this workshop, you will use an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account to run the Lab exercises. This account will give you access to the Always Free resources in Oracle Cloud Free Tier and a limited time trial period with an expanded set of services. Once this period elapses, you can continue to use the Always Free resources with no interruptions.

Always Free and Free Trial instances can be seamlessly upgraded to pay at any time. Existing Oracle Cloud customers have access to Always Free services automatically---no new sign up required.
